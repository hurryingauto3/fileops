### Burstable Compute Strategy
- **Base Layer**: 2 t3.micro instances ($0.0104/hr)
- **Burst Layer**: Up to 20 c6g.xlarge spot instances
- **Cost Efficiency**: 90% savings vs traditional setup
- **Processing Speed**: 500ms/page with auto-scaling

When a request arrives:
1. Queue depth triggers worker auto-scaling
2. Spot instances spin up in 20-30 seconds
3. Tasks are distributed for parallel processing
4. Workers scale down when queue empties
5. Pay only for actual processing time

## 🏗 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask, Celery
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **Storage**: S3, PostgreSQL, Redis
